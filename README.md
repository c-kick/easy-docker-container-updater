# üê≥ Easy Docker Container Updater
Easy Docker Container Updater is a NodeJS script which offers an simple way to maintain centralized configurations & automate updates to Docker containers. It is intended specifically for users with limited knowledge of Docker, who run containers on their (private NAS) server and want a fire-and-forget update solution. 

It is particularly useful for those running a large amount of [*arr](https://wiki.servarr.com) containers. 

## Requirements:
- NodeJS (v8.0.0 or higher)
- A text-editor to configure the script

## Installation
Clone the repository inside the directory of your choice:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/c-kick/easy-docker-container-updater.git
   cd easy-docker-container-updater
   npm install
   npm run config
   ```
Or:
1. Download `container-update.js` and `container-config-example.js` and place them (together) in a directory of your choosing.
2. Copy and rename the example configuration file, `container-config-example.js`, to `container-config.js`, i.e:

	```bash
	cp container-config-example.js container-config.js
	```
## Configuration

Open `container-config.js` with a text-editor and first adjust the `options` object to fit your configuration. The file is annotated, so should be self-explanatory.
The actual configurations for each container reside in the `container` object.
   - Note: you can basically assign anything you want to the `arguments` object inside each container configuration entry; it will eventually get flattened into a `docker create` command.

### Example container configuration

<details>
  <summary>Click here for an example container config entry</summary>

  Note: `container-config-example.js` also contains an example configuration.

  ```js
  'plex': {

    debug: true, //optional - override debug mode for this container

    image: 'plexinc/pms-docker:plexpass', // required - the repository & image to use

    alwaysRun: false, // optional - if true, this will force the container to run, even when it was stopped prior to updating. Note: this is *not* the restart policy, which is configured inside the `arguments` object (below).

    // The arguments that will be passed to 'docker create'
    // Note: all arguments are optional. If you have no arguments, just leave it empty (`arguments: {}`)
    arguments: {

      net: 	'bridge', // Network mode (bridge, host, etc)

      // If you need ports (i.e. in 'bridge' network mode)
      // specify them here, as [host-side-port, container-side-port]
      p: [
      	[32400, 32400],
      ],

      // Volume mappings
      v: [
        ['/my-custom/path-1', '/path-1/'],
        //add more if needed
      ],

      // Environment variables
      e: {
        TZ: 'Europe/Amsterdam',
        PLEX_UID: 1234,
        PLEX_GID: 45678
        //add more if needed
      },

      // Device mappings
      device: [
        ['/dev/dri', '/dev/dri'],
        //add more if needed
      ],

      privileged: 	false,	// optional - privileged mode

      memory:		'768m', // optional - memory limit
     
      restart: 		'always', // optional - restart policy

      // Add whatever other arguments you need. E.g. stuff like: gpus: 'all'
    },

  },
  ```
Note that optional values will fall back to defaults inside the `options` object (and if not there, to hard-coded defaults), if not specified.

## Usage

### Update a single container

Running the command

```bash
node container-update.js plex
```

Updates the `plex` container, if there is an update available for the image configured for it. 

In more detail, it will:
- Check if a container entry named `plex` exists inside the `containers` object in `container-config.js`,
- Check if a container config path for `plex` exists inside the `configBasePath` path, and if not; create it,
- Download the (let's assume this is the configured image) `plexinc/pms-docker:plexpass` image,
- Check if the image is up-to-date or has been updated, and if it is;
	- Check if a container named `plex` exists in Docker, and if it does; stop and delete the old container,
	- (Re)create a `plex` container based on the config defined for `plex` inside the `containers` object in `container-config.js`,
	- Start the container if it existed and was already running before the update (or run it if `alwaysRun` is `true`),
- If the container was actually updated, an e-mail is dispatched with the update summary, 
  if a recipient was entered in `email_to` inside the `options` object.
- If there is no update for the image, the script does nothing, and if something is wrong, it will output an error.

### Update *all* containers

Running the command

```bash
node container-update.js --all
```

Will do the same as above, but for **all** containers configured in the `containers` object in `container-config.js`. 
After all containers are processed, a report is sent, detailing how many were processed, how many were updated, and how many 
failed. 

This option is especially useful if you want your containers to update regularly; just create a scheduled task with this command, 
and the script handles the rest.

### Force updating a container

If a container has no updates, but you explicitely need to delete and re-create it, run:

```bash
node container-update.js plex true
```

This will run the `plex` container update process, regardless of an actual image update.

### Force updating a container with a different image

To force an update using a different image, run:

```bash
node container-update.js plex plexinc/pms-docker:public
```

This will run the `plex` container update process, using the `plexinc/pms-docker:public` image, regardless of an actual image update.

### Force update *all* containers

You probably only ever want to do this, but if you do, running the command:

```bash
node container-update.js --all true
```

Will run a forced update on *all* configured containers.

## Command structure overview

```bash
node container-update.js <container> <image> <forced>
```

Breakdown:
- `./container-update.js` - The (path to) the Easy Docker Container Updater script
- `<container>` - The name of the container to update.
  - You can also pass `--all` here, to update *all* configured containers.
- `<image>` - (optional) The name of the repository:image to use. Use this to override the `image` configured for this container in the `containers` object in `container-config.js`.
- `<forced>` - (optional) Set `true` if you want to force-update a container, even when its image has no available update.

### Notes
- If you don't want any e-mail reports, blank out the `email_to` option (or set it to `null`) in  the `options` in `container-config.js`.
- If you have many containers configured, but want to debug just one of them, you can override the global `debug` flag from *inside* a container config. Just set `debug : true` in the container's config entry.
