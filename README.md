## Introduction

Easy Docker Container Updater is a Node.js script I originally wrote to streamline the update process for my containers when I was just starting out with Docker. 
Years later, it‚Äôs still reliably handling my container updates, so I decided to publish it as open-source.
This tool is designed for users who want a simple way to manage and update Docker containers‚Äîparticularly on private NAS or home servers. 
It‚Äôs perfect for beginners or home server enthusiasts who want more control over their containers, or just anyone looking for a lightweight, 
‚Äúfire-and-forget‚Äù solution without having to dive into something like [Watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower).

### Features
- **Centralized**: Manage all your container settings in a single place.
- **Flexible**: Define and reuse variables across multiple containers for a more uniform setup; particularly useful for use with [*arr](https://wiki.servarr.com) containers.
- **Lightweight**: Just a single script‚Äîno additional containers or advanced tools needed.
- **Schedule Updates and Receive Email Reports**: Schedule updating all your container, whenever *you* want it, with optional email update reports.
- **Ideal for NAS/Home Server Users**: Designed to be simple yet powerful for small-scale setups

### Example Usage
To update all your containers in succession:
```bash
./container-update.js --all
```
To update a specific container:
```bash
./container-update.js <container_name>
```

### Why not just use Watchtower?

By all means, if you use them; great! Then this script is not for you. Easy Docker Container Updater doesn't offer any new features or functionality that those management-tools lack. Instead, it‚Äôs designed specifically for users who find those tools overly complex or intimidating for their needs.

The main *'raison d'√™tre'* for Easy Docker Container Updater is that I needed to break out of the constraints of Synology's native container manager, create a simple way to define container configurations with common parameters that I could use across multiple containers (such as path mappings), and have my containers update automatically without any intervention from me whatsoever. And make all this managable in one place.

## Requirements:
- Docker
- NodeJS (15.14.0 or higher)
- A text-editor to configure the script

## Installation
### Using Git
If you have Git installed, you can clone the repository inside the directory of your choice:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/c-kick/easy-docker-container-updater.git
   cd easy-docker-container-updater
   npm install
   npm run config
   ```
> **Note:** The `npm` commands are optional, and just make the process of creating a config file a little bit easier. If you have no NPM installed, just follow step 2 below ('Manually') to complete the configuration.
### Manually
1. Download `container-update.js` and `container-config-example.js` and place them (together) in a directory of your choosing.
2. Copy and rename the example configuration file, `container-config-example.js`, to `container-config.js`, i.e:

   ```bash
   cp container-config-example.js container-config.js
   ```

## Configuration
> **Note:** See the [Reference section](#reference) for a description of all options you can use.

- Open `container-config.js` in a text editor and adjust the `options` object to fit your setup (the only required, and mandatory settings is `configBasePath`).
- Each container you wish to manage/update should be defined in the `containers` object. See the 'plex' container example inside `container-config-example.js`, and consult the [reference section](#container-configuration-entry) for a list of available settings.

## Usage

### Quick Start
Run the script with the following commands to update containers:

- **Update a Single Container**: `node container-update.js <container_name>`
- **Update All Containers**: `node container-update.js --all`

### Update A Single Container

Running the command

```bash
node container-update.js plex
```

Updates the `plex` container, if there is an update available for the image configured for it. 

In more detail, it will:
- Check if a container entry named `plex` exists inside the `containers` object in `container-config.js`,
- Check if a container config path for `plex` exists inside the `configBasePath` path, and if not; create it,
- Download the (let's assume this is the configured image) `plexinc/pms-docker:plexpass` image,
- Check if the image is up-to-date or has been updated, and if it is;
	- Check if a container named `plex` exists in Docker, and if it does; stop and delete the old container,
	- (Re)create a `plex` container based on the config defined for `plex` inside the `containers` object in `container-config.js`,
	- Start the container if it existed and was already running before the update (or run it if `alwaysRun` is `true`),
- If the container was actually updated, an e-mail is dispatched with the update summary, 
  if a recipient was entered in `email_to` inside the `options` object.
- If there is no update for the image, the script does nothing, and if something is wrong, it will output an error.

> **Note:** If you don't want any e-mail reports, blank out the `email_to` option (or set it to `null`) in  the `options` in `container-config.js`.

### Update *all* containers

Running the command

```bash
node container-update.js --all
```

Will do the same as above, but for **all** containers configured in the `containers` object in `container-config.js`. 
After all containers are processed, a report is sent, detailing how many were processed, how many were updated, and how many 
failed. 

This option is especially useful if you want your containers to update regularly; just create a scheduled task with this command, 
and the script handles the rest.

### Force updating a container

If a container has no updates, but you explicitely need to delete and re-create it, run:

```bash
node container-update.js plex true
```

This will run the `plex` container update process, regardless of an actual image update.

### Force updating a container with a different image

To force an update using a different image, run:

```bash
node container-update.js plex plexinc/pms-docker:public
```

This will run the `plex` container update process, using the `plexinc/pms-docker:public` image, regardless of an actual image update, while retaining the configuration you defined. Useful if you just want to quickly try out another image version. 

### Force update *all* containers

You probably only ever want to do this, but if you do, running the command:

```bash
node container-update.js --all true
```

Will run a forced update on *all* configured containers.

### Optional: stay up to date
If you have pulled the script via Git, and want to make sure you have the latest version of the updater each time you run it, you can call:

```bash
cd /your/path/to/easy-docker-container-updater && git pull && node ./container-update.js --all
```
